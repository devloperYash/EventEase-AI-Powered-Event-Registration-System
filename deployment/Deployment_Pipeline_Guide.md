# EventEase Deployment Pipeline Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the deployment strategy for EventEase from Development to Production environments using VS Code and SFDX CLI.

## Environment Strategy

### 1. Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Active development and unit testing
- **Org Type**: Developer Sandbox or Developer Edition
- **Access**: Development team
- **Data**: Test data only

### 2. UAT Environment  
- **Purpose**: User Acceptance Testing and integration testing
- **Org Type**: Full Sandbox
- **Access**: Business users, QA team, Development team
- **Data**: Production-like test data

### 3. Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live system for end users
- **Org Type**: Production Org
- **Access**: End users, System administrators
- **Data**: Live business data

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Development to UAT
- [ ] All unit tests passing (minimum 75% code coverage)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Feature testing completed in Dev environment
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Change log prepared

### UAT to Production
- [ ] User Acceptance Testing completed
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Production data backup completed
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Change management approval obtained

## Deployment Commands

### 1. Validate Deployment (Dry Run)
```bash
# Validate against UAT
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app -u uat-org --checkonly --testlevel RunLocalTests

# Validate against Production
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app -u prod-org --checkonly --testlevel RunLocalTests
```

### 2. Deploy to UAT
```bash
# Deploy metadata
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app -u uat-org --testlevel RunLocalTests

# Verify deployment
sfdx force:org:open -u uat-org
```

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Final validation
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app -u prod-org --checkonly --testlevel RunLocalTests

# Production deployment
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app -u prod-org --testlevel RunLocalTests

# Open production org
sfdx force:org:open -u prod-org
```

## Deployment Components

### Core Metadata Components
- Custom Objects (Event__c, Attendee__c, Registration__c, Feedback__c)
- Custom Fields and Relationships
- Validation Rules
- Triggers and Apex Classes
- Lightning Web Components
- Page Layouts and FlexiPages
- Permission Sets and Profiles
- Duplicate Rules and Matching Rules

### Data Components (Separate Process)
- Reference data (picklist values)
- Master data (events, attendees)
- Configuration data (org settings)

## Backup Strategy

### Before Production Deployment
1. **Metadata Backup**
   ```bash
   sfdx force:source:retrieve -p force-app -u prod-org
   ```

2. **Data Backup**
   - Export critical data using Data Loader
   - Document current configuration settings
   - Save current permission assignments

3. **Configuration Backup**
   - Export reports and dashboards
   - Document integration settings
   - Save email template configurations

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Within 24 hours)
1. Use Salesforce Setup â†’ Deployment Status
2. Select failed deployment
3. Click "Rollback" if available

### Manual Rollback
1. Deploy previous version from version control
2. Restore data from backup if necessary
3. Revert configuration changes
4. Notify users of rollback completion

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Create test event
- [ ] Register test attendee
- [ ] Verify email notifications
- [ ] Test bulk registration
- [ ] Validate reports and dashboards

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Monitor system performance
- [ ] Check governor limit usage
- [ ] Verify batch job execution
- [ ] Test with production data volume

### Security Testing
- [ ] Verify field-level security
- [ ] Test user permissions
- [ ] Validate sharing rules
- [ ] Check audit trail functionality

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Monitoring
- System performance metrics
- Error logs and exceptions
- User adoption metrics
- Data quality issues

### Weekly Reviews
- Deployment success rates
- Test coverage reports
- User feedback analysis
- Performance optimization opportunities

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Issue Response
1. **Immediate**: Disable affected functionality
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and root cause
3. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders
4. **Resolution**: Apply hotfix or rollback
5. **Follow-up**: Post-incident review

### Hotfix Deployment
```bash
# Emergency deployment (skip some tests if critical)
sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app/main/default/classes/HotfixClass.cls -u prod-org --testlevel NoTestRun
```

## Best Practices

### Version Control
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Tag releases with version numbers
- Maintain feature branches for development
- Document all changes in changelog

### Testing Strategy
- Maintain minimum 85% code coverage
- Include integration tests
- Test with realistic data volumes
- Validate all user scenarios

### Communication
- Notify users of upcoming deployments
- Provide training for new features
- Document known issues and workarounds
- Maintain deployment calendar

## Compliance and Audit

### Documentation Requirements
- Deployment logs and results
- Test execution reports
- Change approval records
- User access modifications

### Audit Trail
- All deployments logged with timestamps
- User permission changes tracked
- Data modifications documented
- System configuration changes recorded
