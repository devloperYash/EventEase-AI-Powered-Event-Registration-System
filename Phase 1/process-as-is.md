# Current-State Process (As-Is)

1) Event Creation
- Events are planned in spreadsheets or third-party tools; limited capacity tracking.
- Venue details tracked separately; no consistent data model.

2) Registration
- Attendees submit via Google Forms/Eventbrite/Email; manual consolidation.
- Confirmations sent manually; calendar invite errors common.
- Payment (if any) processed externally; reconciliation is manual.

3) Reminders & Follow-Up
- No standardized schedule; reminders sent ad-hoc or not at all.
- Missed communications and inconsistent opt-out handling.

4) Onsite Check-in
- Manual name lookups; paper lists or ad-hoc QR tools.
- Attendance status often not captured in a system of record.

5) Reporting
- Periodic spreadsheet exports; slow and error-prone.
- No unified dashboards for trends, revenue, or no-show rate.

## Pain Points
- Data fragmentation and high manual effort.
- Poor visibility into real-time registration and attendance.
- Inconsistent communications; low engagement.
- Difficult ROI measurement and forecasting.
