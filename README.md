## Project Overview
**Industry:** Event Management / Education / Corporate Training  
**Project Type:** B2C Salesforce CRM Implementation  
**Target Users:** Event Organizers, Attendees, Administrators  

### Problem Statement
Event organizers often rely on manual registration or multiple tools to manage attendees, send confirmations, and track participation. This leads to inefficiency, data loss, poor follow-up, and lack of clear analytics.  

There is a need for a **centralized Salesforce CRM** to manage events, automate registrations, send AI-driven reminders, and generate real-time insights.

## Use Cases

1. **Event Management**
   - Maintain a central database of events with details like date, venue, and capacity.  

2. **Attendee Registration**
   - Capture registrations online or on-site.  
   - Send automated email confirmations.  

3. **AI-Powered Recommendations**
   - Suggest relevant events to attendees based on their interests and past participation.  

4. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Dashboards for organizers to track attendance trends, popular events, and revenue.
